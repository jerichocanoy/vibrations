								<p>“A Familiar Face” Lauren Jones</p>
								<p>Lost and Found is a three-piece composite series exploring self-discovery and escaping the confines of external pressures. Each image portrays a crucial part of the subject’s journey toward personal autonomy and liberation. True liberation oftenaises from the courage to stray from the beaten path and embrace self-exploration.</p>

								<p>“Ursa Minor” Alyssa Jeffery</p>
								<p> They’re de-icing a plane today.</p>
								<p> It feels like it shouldn’t work, and yet it does anyway. They spray some kind of fluid onto the plane, which on its own feels like it shouldn’t work– adding liquid onto a cold surface should only freeze it further, shouldn’t it? The answer to that is apparently no, because the de-icing fluid doesn’t freeze at these temperatures. It even gets heated before they spray it. And then they apply anti-icing fluids too, to ensure that the ice doesn’t come right back.</p>
								<P>You don’t know this off the top of your head, of
course. You know this because you’ve spent an
inordinate amount of time listening to videos
discussing plane crashes today. Maybe not the
smartest idea when you’re expecting someone by
plane, but you haven’t had any particularly smart
ideas since grad school.</P>
<p>It must be cold out there, operating those machines.
Sure, it doesn’t freeze, but the liquid’s still wet. You
wonder if the workers keep a change of clothes so
they can keep working down on the tarmac without
freezing. Perhaps the ground crews wear rain jackets
when spraying off the planes. The thought alone is
fairly amusing.</p>
<p>A plane lands on the runway. You watch the way
it seems to hover just above before it finally lands,
a bird of prey finally deciding on its next meal,
Alaska emblazoned across its feathers. Must’ve had a
connection at some point, because you’re fairly sure
that airline doesn’t fly to New Zealand. You double-
check on your phone and get mostly ads for flights
you will never take.</p>
<p>The Alaska plane comes around from the runway
and taxis out of sight. You watch it go for a
moment, then start packing up the nest of cabling,
devices, and books you’ve slowly taken out over the
hours of waiting. You must look like some kind of
contemporary art piece. Maybe something making
306074_02_EVCC_Vibrations Sheetbody.indd 13 those tired, recycled statements about technology
taking over everyone’s lives, braids visually similar
enough to pass for cabling– provided the observer
stands at the right distance, of course; just behind
the flimsy barrier that separates you from the rest of
the airport.</p>
<p>The returning of your items to your bag is a quick
process. Everything has a little space it slots into
perfectly. Books cushion your laptop, just in case you
were to take a bad fall on the icy sidewalks outside.
You’re sure they’re salted at the very least, but it
never hurts to be prepared. The cabling goes into
your bag too, and within a few minutes the statue
you once were is gone.</p>
<p>You mindlessly clean your glasses with the edge
of your shirt to avoid biting your nails while you
wait. It’s not quite right material-wise; the fabric
smudges more than it cleans– but it’s somewhere to
spend the energ y crawling under your skin. You can
hear the chatter and footsteps of people coming this
way, the chorus of “oooh...” and “wow” that always
comes with tourists watching the sun dip towards
the horizon at two in the afternoon. It never fails
to amuse, watching someone see it for the very first
time.</p>
<p>Of course, you know your sibling won’t ever be one
of those people.</p>
<p>[creative writing]
A short story about family conflicts, featuring
two characters I hold near and dear to my heart.
Tethys, the protagonist, lives about as far as it
gets from their sibling, Acrux, who’s been busy
with academia and Antarctica- until now.</p>

							<h3>RIZE By Gina Marie D’Amico</h3>
							<p>RIZE</p>
								<p> Like a knife through a cage, unleash the<br>
								rage . . .</br></p>
								
								<p>Of hurt that’s been trapped inside.</br>
								Let the raindrops fall, from the mountain
								<br>tall...and just
								<br>swallow your damn pride.</br></p>
								
								<p>It’s been re-stiched for years, it’s bursting
								<br>with all
								<br>fears...and worries that won’t go away.</br></p>
								
								<p>For this cage is my rib, and it’s splintered
								<br>big...I just
								<br>want to escape every day.</br></p>
								
								<p>Between the whirlwinds of time, and the
								<br>practicing
								<br>mimes...that, you use, to grow.
								<br>Love and light, with all your might, you
								<br>bleed and
								<br>it s e e p s in your soul.</br></p>
								
								<p>Yet the fight that you suffer through, and
								<br>g r o w
								<br>accustomed to...you continuously try to
								<br>change.</br></p>
								
								<p>Cause it’s for the best, and you need that
								<br>growth...so
								<br>you better best behave.</br></p>
								
								<p>For this rib is my heart, and it keeps
								<br>breaking apart, but
								<br>I March on Fourth, each day.</br></p>
								
								<p>Re-experiencing and re-feeling, the wheels
								<br>don’t stop
								<br>turning...and I beg it to just go away.</br></p>
								
								<p>All I can do, is push on through, cause I
								<br>want to
								<br>get rid of this pain...</br></p>
								
								<p>In my brain, it’s non stop rain, and I just
								<br>want
								<br>the storm delayed..</br></p>
								
								<p>So here I lay, in the cold shade...of terror
								<br>that is
								<br>unknown, but I face my fears, and get
								<br>through the
								<br>tears..because I have a strong backbone
								<br>Cause the road is long, or maybe not far
								<br>on, so I’ll face
								<br>my future with opened eyes...</br></p>
								
								<p>For I am she, and I carry me...and because
								<br>of
								<br>this...I WILL RIZE!</br></p>

							<h3>kicking my feet By Hannah Jean Myers</h3>
							<p>Got my green-starred sneakers</p>
							<p>And I’m walking out the door</p>
							<p>A briefcase in my left hand,</p>
							<p>I can only hope for more</p>
							<p>Cause school is far,</p>
							<p>But makes the heart grow fonder</p>

							<p>What more life’s got to offer</p>

							<h3>You Are Not the Moon By Lilly Lovato</h3>
							<p>You are not the moon,
							<p>	calm and silver and out of reach
							<p>You are the busted flashlight
							<p>that flickers just when the thunder roars
							<p>You are not the ocean,
							<p>wide and deep and murmuring
							<p>You are the puddle in my shoe
							<p>after dancing in the rain
							<p>You are the song stuck in my head
							<p>that I didn’t ask for
							<p>not the chorus, just the ringing ear worm
							<p>You are not the fireplace,
							<p>but the smoke alarm going off at 3 AM.
							<p>still,
							<p>you are also the peanut butter spoon
							<p>when I crave a sweet treat
							<p>You are the noise,
							<p>but sometimes you are the echo
							<p>I didn’t know I missed.</p>

								<!-- fourth poem-->

								<h3>Beneath By Lilly Lovato</h3>
								<p>Beneath a moon that never wanes,
									<p>I walked alone through glassy plains
									<p>	The trees were bent with eyes like flame,
									<p>	And each one knew my secret name
									<p>The sky, a quilt of stitched regret,
									<p>Hung low with stars not rising yet
									<p>A hush like breath behind a door
									<p>Crept closer than it had before
									<p>A house appeared, no roof, no light,
									<p>Its halls were bones, its walls were night
									<p>I knocked, and heard my voice reply,
									<p>	But warped and low, not quite a lie
									<p>	Inside, a mirror faced the wall,
									<p>And shadows danced without a call
									<p>They whispered truths I dared not know
									<p>That I had built this long ago
									<p>The wind grew still, the clocks all ceased,
									<p>As if some ancient pact released
									<p>And in the dark, my hands were bare
									<p>No key, no path, no prayer, no prayer</p>
